# Working on a remote machine

## Connecting to a distant machine

The command to connect to a distance machine is `ssh` (*Secure Shell*):
`ssh <login>@<host>`.


## Sending/getting files to/from a distance machine

Two options here, `scp` or `rsync`

I would recommand using `rsync` which has several advantages over `scp`:






`ssh`
`scp`
`rsync`
`ssh config`
